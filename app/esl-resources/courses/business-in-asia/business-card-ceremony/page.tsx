    reading: `In the West, a business card is a convenience. You hand one over, the other person puts it in their pocket, and maybe they call you later. Nobody thinks about it too much.

In Asia, a business card is not just a card. It is you. It represents your company, your position, and your identity. The way you give your card, the way you receive someone else's card, and what you do with it afterwards — all of this tells the other person who you are and how much respect you have.

Get it right, and you make a strong first impression. Get it wrong, and you may lose a business relationship before it even starts.

In this lesson, you will learn the business card rules for four countries: Japan, South Korea, China, and Thailand. Each country has its own customs, but they share one idea — the business card is a ceremony, not just an exchange.`,

    reading: `Japan has the most formal business card culture in the world. The Japanese word for business card is "meishi" (名刺), and the exchange is called "meishi koukan" (名刺交換). It is a ritual — every step has a rule.

When you give your card, hold it with both hands. Your fingers should be on the corners. The text should face the other person so they can read it. Bow slightly as you present it. Say your name and company clearly.

When you receive a card, take it with both hands. Look at it carefully. Read the person's name and title. Do not put it in your pocket immediately — this is very rude. If you are sitting at a table, place the cards in front of you in order of seniority, with the most senior person's card on top or to the left.

Never write on a business card in Japan. Do not bend it, fold it, or play with it. Do not put it in your back pocket — sitting on someone's card is deeply disrespectful. Always carry a card holder (meishi-ire). Pulling cards from your wallet or bag looks unprofessional.

One more important rule: always bring enough cards. Running out of business cards in Japan is embarrassing. It suggests you did not prepare properly for the meeting.`,

    reading: `South Korea shares many business customs with Japan, but with important differences. The Korean word for business card is "myeongham" (명함). Like Japan, respect and hierarchy are central to Korean business culture.

When exchanging cards with someone older or more senior, use both hands. For someone of equal rank, you may use your right hand while supporting your right wrist with your left hand — this small gesture shows respect. The most junior person should present their card first.

In Korea, age matters as much as job title. One of the first things Koreans do when they meet someone new is figure out who is older. This decides the level of language they use — Korean has different levels of politeness, and using the wrong level can cause offence.

After receiving a card, read it carefully and make a positive comment if you can: "Oh, you work at Samsung? That is a great company." Place the card on the table during the meeting, just like in Japan. Do not write on it in front of the person.

Business relationships in Korea are often built after work hours. Dinner and drinking (hoesik) are an important part of building trust. Do not be surprised if someone you just exchanged cards with invites you for drinks the same evening. Saying yes is almost always the right answer.`,

    emoji: '🇨🇳',
    reading: `In China, the business card is called a "mingpian" (名片). Like Japan and Korea, there are important rules to follow. But China also has its own unique customs.

The most important rule: if you do business in China, print your card in both English and Chinese. The Chinese text should be on the back of the card. When you present your card, hold it with both hands and make sure the Chinese side faces the person you are giving it to. This shows you have made an effort to communicate in their language.

Gold text on a business card is seen as prestigious in China. Red is also a lucky colour. White cards with black text are fine, but plain white can sometimes be associated with death and mourning in Chinese culture.

When you receive a card, accept it with both hands, read it carefully, and make eye contact with the person. Never write on a Chinese business card. Place it on the table during the meeting.

The most important concept in Chinese business is "guanxi" (关系), which means relationships. Business in China is built on personal connections, not just contracts. The business card exchange is the first step in building guanxi. If you handle it well, you show that you understand Chinese culture and are worth doing business with.

Always bring more cards than you think you need. In China, you may meet many people at one event. Running out of cards means missed connections — and in China, connections are everything.`,

    title: 'Thailand — The Naam Bat',
    emoji: '🇹🇭',
    reading: `Thailand has a more relaxed business card culture than Japan or Korea, but respect still matters. The Thai word for business card is "naam bat" (นามบัตร).

Before you exchange cards, you should do the "wai" — the Thai greeting where you press your palms together and bow your head slightly. The height of your hands shows the level of respect: higher for someone more senior, lower for someone equal. Getting the wai right makes a better first impression than any business card.

Give your card with your right hand, or with both hands if the person is senior to you. Never use your left hand alone — in Thai culture, the left hand is considered less clean. If you have Thai text on the back of your card, present it with the Thai side facing the person.

Thai business culture uses the concepts of "phi" (พี่) and "nong" (น้อง). Phi means the older or more senior person. Nong means the younger or junior person. Even in business, Thais often use these words instead of formal titles. Once you build a good relationship, people may call you "Phi [name]" as a sign of closeness and respect.

Important: never put a business card near your feet or on the floor. In Thai culture, the feet are the lowest part of the body, and putting something near them is very disrespectful. Always keep cards in a card holder or in the top pocket of your jacket.

Thailand values politeness and smooth relationships above everything. Avoid direct conflict or criticism, even if you disagree. Smile, be patient, and show genuine interest in the other person. The business card exchange is just the beginning — what matters is the relationship you build after it.`,

    title: 'The Mistakes Foreigners Make',
    emoji: '⚠️',
    reading: `Here are the most common mistakes that foreign businesspeople make with business cards in Asia. Each one can damage a first impression.

Mistake 1: The Back Pocket.  Putting someone's business card in your back pocket is one of the worst things you can do in Japan, Korea, China, or Thailand. You are literally sitting on their identity. Always use a card holder or put it in your jacket pocket.

Mistake 2: Writing on the Card.  In the West, people sometimes write notes on business cards — "met at conference" or "call next week." In Asia, writing on someone's card is like writing on their face. Never do it in front of the person. If you need to take notes, write them on your own paper later.

Mistake 3: The One-Handed Toss.  In casual Western business culture, people sometimes slide a card across the table or hand it over with one hand while looking at their phone. In Asia, this looks careless and disrespectful. Always use both hands and give the card your full attention.

Mistake 4: Not Reading the Card.  When someone gives you their card, they expect you to read it. Look at their name, their title, their company. If possible, make a comment: "Oh, you are the Director of Marketing?" Putting the card away without looking at it suggests the person is not important to you.

Mistake 5: Running Out of Cards.  This shows you did not prepare. In Japan especially, it is embarrassing. Bring at least 30 cards to any business event.

Mistake 6: Forgetting the Card Holder.  Pulling cards from your wallet, your bag, or your trouser pocket looks unprofessional. A proper card holder shows you take business seriously.`,

Scenario 1: Tokyo Office Meeting
You are visiting a Japanese company for the first time. You arrive at the reception area and are taken to a meeting room. Three people are waiting: the Department Manager (bucho), the Section Chief (kacho), and a junior staff member. You need to exchange cards with all three. Who do you give your card to first? How do you present it?

Scenario 2: Seoul Business Dinner
You are at a restaurant in Seoul. Your Korean business contact arrives with two colleagues. One is clearly older (grey hair, senior position), one is about your age. They stand up when you arrive. What do you do first — the wai? The handshake? The card exchange? How does your approach change depending on who you are addressing?

Scenario 3: Guangzhou Trade Fair
You are at a trade fair in China. You have a small booth. Many people are visiting your booth throughout the day. Some give you their cards, some just ask questions. By the afternoon, you have received about 40 cards. How do you keep track of them? What do you do with them after the fair? If you run out of your own cards, what should you do?

Scenario 4: Bangkok School Meeting
You are meeting the director of a Thai international school. She is about 60 years old and clearly very senior. Two younger staff members are with her. As you enter the meeting room, how do you greet them? What level of wai is appropriate for the director versus the junior staff?`,

Japan: The most formal. Always use both hands. Bow. Read the card. Never write on it. Use a card holder (meishi-ire). Place cards on the table in order of seniority.

South Korea: Similar to Japan, but age is especially important. The junior person presents their card first. Support your right wrist with your left hand for a respectful one-handed exchange. Be ready for after-work socialising.

China: Print your card in English and Chinese. Present the Chinese side facing up. Gold text shows prestige. Guanxi (relationships) matters more than rules. Bring extra cards.

Thailand: Do the wai first. Use your right hand or both hands. Never put cards near your feet. Phi/nong (senior/junior) relationships are important. Politeness and patience matter more than formality.

Across all four countries: Use both hands when possible. Read the card carefully. Never write on it. Use a card holder. Bring more cards than you think you need. And remember — the card exchange is not just about information. It is about respect.

Today, many Asian businesses also use digital tools like LinkedIn and WeChat for contacts. But the physical business card is still important, especially for first meetings.
