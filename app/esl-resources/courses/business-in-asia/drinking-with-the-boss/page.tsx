    title: 'Why After-Work Drinking Matters in Asia',
    emoji: '🍻',
    reading: `In many Western companies, work finishes at 5 or 6 p.m. and people go home. Going for a drink with colleagues is nice, but it is optional. Nobody thinks it will affect your career.

In much of Asia, the evening is part of the working day. Dinner and drinks with your team, your boss, or your clients are where real relationships are built. In the office, people are polite and careful. After a few drinks, they relax, speak more openly, and start to trust each other.

This is why invitations to after-work dinners can feel less like invitations and more like expectations. Saying no too often can make you look unfriendly, or like you are not part of the team.

But drinking culture is not the same everywhere. Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand all have different rules, different drinks, and different ideas about what is polite. And things are changing fast — younger workers are pushing back, and many people do not drink at all.

In this lesson, you will learn the rules of the table in four countries, how to say no politely, and how to handle the situations that confuse most foreigners.`,

    title: 'South Korea — Hoesik',
    emoji: '🇰🇷',
    reading: `In South Korea, a company dinner is called "hoesik" (회식). It usually starts with Korean barbecue and soju, and it can continue to a second place for beer, and sometimes a third place for karaoke (noraebang). These rounds are called "il-cha", "i-cha", and "sam-cha" — first round, second round, third round.

Korean drinking has clear rules based on age and rank. Never pour your own drink. Instead, you pour for others, and they pour for you. When you pour for someone senior, hold the bottle with two hands, or with your right hand while your left hand touches your right arm.

When a senior person pours for you, hold your glass with two hands. When you drink in front of someone much older or more senior, turn your head slightly to the side and cover your mouth with your hand. This small gesture shows respect.

The first glass is often finished in one go after the toast. After that, people usually wait until a glass is empty before refilling it — so if you do not want more, leave a little in your glass.

Hoesik culture is changing. Many younger Koreans feel it takes away their free time. Some companies now follow a "1-1-9" rule: one venue, one type of drink, and finish by 9 p.m. Others have replaced evening hoesik with lunches, movies, or bowling.`,

    title: 'Japan — Nomikai',

    reading: `In Japan, a work drinking party is called a "nomikai" (飲み会). Many happen at an izakaya — a casual Japanese pub that serves small plates of food. Big seasonal parties include "bonenkai" at the end of the year and "kangeikai" to welcome new staff.

The most important rule: do not drink until everyone has a drink and someone says "kanpai" (乾杯). Starting before the toast is a classic foreigner's mistake. Many groups start with beer for everyone, so it is easy to order quickly.

Like in Korea, you pour for others, not for yourself. Watch the glasses of the people next to you — especially your boss. When a glass is getting low, offer to fill it. If someone pours for you, lift your glass with both hands. If you do not want more, leave your glass full. An empty glass is an invitation to refill it.

There is an old idea called "bureiko" (無礼講), which means that rank does not matter tonight and people can speak freely. Be careful! In reality, many Japanese workers still remember what was said. Speaking too freely to your boss can cause problems the next morning.

Nomikai culture is also changing. Many young Japanese workers prefer not to attend, and more companies now offer non-alcoholic drinks or lunch events instead. Saying "Otsukaresama deshita" at the end — "thank you for your hard work" — is always a polite way to finish.`,

    title: 'China — Ganbei and the Banquet',

    reading: `In China, business drinking usually happens at a banquet — a big dinner at a round table with many dishes in the middle. The seating is important. The host sits facing the door, and the most important guest sits at the host's right side.

The famous toast is "ganbei" (干杯), which literally means "dry glass". When someone says ganbei, they often expect you to finish your glass. The traditional drink at formal banquets is "baijiu" (白酒), a very strong clear spirit that can be more than 50% alcohol. It is served in very small glasses — but the toasts keep coming.

Toasting in China is not only done all together. People also make personal toasts. The host may toast each guest, and guests should toast the host in return. When you clink glasses with someone more senior, hold your glass slightly lower than theirs. This shows humility and respect.

If you do not want to finish your glass, you can say "suiyi" (随意), which means "as you like". This lets you take a small sip instead of drinking everything. Many people also switch to tea, juice, or beer.

Remember that the banquet is about building "guanxi" — relationships. Accepting a toast, making a short speech to thank your host, and showing interest in the people at the table matters more than how much you drink.`,

In Thailand, business dinners are friendly and long. Beer is often served with ice in the glass, which surprises many visitors — but in the Thai heat, it makes sense. Whisky or local spirits may be shared from one bottle, mixed with soda and ice. The younger or more junior person usually keeps everyone's glass filled. People clink glasses and say "chon kaew" (ชนแก้ว). Nobody is forced to finish their glass, and it is fine to drink slowly.

Thai culture values "sanuk" (fun) and keeping the mood light. Avoid serious arguments at the table. Losing your temper after drinking would cause everyone to lose face. Also remember that on some Buddhist holidays, alcohol sales are not allowed.

In Vietnam, beer drinking with colleagues is very social. The group often counts together — "Một, hai, ba, dzô!" (One, two, three, cheers!) — and drinks at the same time. It can happen many times in one evening.

In Malaysia and Indonesia, most people are Muslim and do not drink alcohol. Many business dinners serve only tea, juice, or soft drinks, and food is halal. Never pressure anyone to drink, and check before you order alcohol at a business meal. In these countries, the relationship is built over food and conversation — not drinks.`,

The key is to protect the relationship and help everyone keep face. Saying "No, I don't drink that" in a cold voice can make your host feel embarrassed. Smiling and giving a short, friendly reason works much better.

Here are strategies that work in most of Asia:

Give a simple reason. "I'm driving tonight" or "My doctor told me not to drink" is accepted almost everywhere. You do not need to explain more than that.

Join the toast anyway. Raise a glass of tea, juice, or water and say "Cheers!" with everyone. Taking part in the toast matters more than what is in your glass.

Take small sips. If you do drink, sip slowly. In Japan and Korea, leave your glass full so nobody refills it. In China, say "suiyi" to drink as you like.

Say it early. Tell your host at the start of the evening, so they are not surprised later.

Stay for the conversation. Even if you are not drinking, staying, laughing, and talking shows that you value the relationship. Leaving very early may send the wrong message.

And if you do drink — know your limit. Making a fool of yourself at a business dinner is much worse than refusing a glass.`,

Anna arrives at an izakaya in Tokyo for her team's welcome party. She is thirsty after a long day. When her beer arrives, she takes a big drink straight away. Two colleagues are still ordering. Her boss is holding his glass, waiting. Why are people looking at her?

Priya does not drink alcohol for religious reasons. She has been invited to a dinner with a Thai client in Bangkok. She is worried that refusing will seem rude. What advice would you give her?

South Korea: Hoesik can have several rounds. Never pour your own drink. Pour and receive with two hands. Turn your head away from seniors when you drink. Many companies now follow shorter, lighter rules like "1-1-9".

Japan: Wait for "kanpai" before drinking. Pour for others and watch your boss's glass. Leave your glass full if you do not want more. Be careful with "bureiko" — people remember what you say. End with "otsukaresama deshita".

China: Banquets are formal and seating matters. "Ganbei" means dry glass, but "suiyi" lets you sip. Hold your glass lower when you clink with someone senior. Toast your host. "I'm driving" is a widely accepted excuse.

Thailand and Southeast Asia: More relaxed. Ice in beer is normal in Thailand. Keep the mood light and avoid arguments. In Vietnam, drink together after "một, hai, ba, dzô". In Malaysia and Indonesia, many people do not drink — never pressure anyone.
