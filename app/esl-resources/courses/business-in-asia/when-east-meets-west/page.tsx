    reading: `A German engineer and a Thai engineer are working on the same project. The German engineer finds a problem and says so clearly in the meeting: "This design will not work." He thinks he is being helpful and honest. The Thai engineer is shocked. He thinks his colleague is being rude and has embarrassed the project manager in front of everyone.

Later, the Thai engineer notices a different problem. He does not say anything in the meeting. Instead, he mentions it quietly to the project manager over lunch. The German engineer never hears about it, and later he is frustrated: "Why didn't anyone tell me?"

Both engineers are good at their jobs. Both want the project to succeed. But they have different ideas about how to communicate, how to respect people, and how to solve problems.

This is what happens when East meets West. Of course, "East" and "West" are huge generalisations. Japan is very different from Thailand, and the USA is very different from Italy. And every person is an individual — not a stereotype. But research on culture shows some useful patterns that can help us understand why misunderstandings happen.

In this final lesson, you will look at four big differences: hierarchy, "I" versus "we", time, and trust. Then you will meet the new generation of "bridge builders" who move easily between cultures — and review everything you have learned in the course.`,

    reading: `Researchers use the term "power distance" to describe how much people in a culture accept that power is shared unequally.

In high power distance cultures — including many Asian countries — there is a clear hierarchy. The boss makes decisions. Juniors show respect and rarely challenge seniors in public. Titles are important. People may call their manager "Director Kim" or "Khun Somchai", never just "Kim" or "Somchai".

In low power distance cultures — such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, and to some extent the USA — the workplace is "flatter". Employees call the CEO by her first name. Juniors are encouraged to question their managers. Meetings are open discussions where anyone can disagree.

When these two styles meet, problems can happen. A Western manager in Asia may ask, "Any questions?" and get silence. They think everyone understands. In fact, the team may not feel comfortable asking questions in front of the boss.

An Asian employee in a Western company may wait to be told what to do. Their Western manager may think they lack initiative. In fact, they are showing respect.

The solution is to adapt. Western managers in Asia can ask for opinions in private, in small groups, or in writing. They can ask specific questions, like "What do you think could go wrong?" Asian employees in Western companies can practise sharing ideas early — and learn that speaking up is often seen as a strength, not as disrespect.`,

    reading: `Another big difference is between individualism and collectivism.

In individualist cultures — such as the USA, the UK, and Australia — people are often seen first as individuals. Personal goals, personal success, and personal opinions are very important. Children are taught to be independent and to "stand out". At work, people expect to be praised for their own achievements.

In collectivist cultures — including most of Asia — people are often seen first as members of a group: their family, their company, their team. Group harmony, loyalty, and shared success matter more than individual glory. A Japanese saying puts it clearly: "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down."

This affects business in many ways.

Praise. A Western manager may praise one employee in front of the whole team. In a collectivist culture, this can make the employee uncomfortable — they may prefer the whole team to be praised.

Decisions. In Japan, decisions are often made through "ringi" (稟議) — a document is passed around and approved by many people — and "nemawashi" — quiet discussions before the meeting. This takes longer, but once a decision is made, everyone supports it. Western companies often decide faster, but may have more disagreement later.

Responsibility. In collectivist cultures, when something goes wrong, the whole team may take responsibility. In individualist cultures, people often want to know exactly who made the mistake.

Neither approach is better. Fast decisions are useful. So is strong group support.`,

    reading: `Cultures also see time differently.

Some cultures see time as a straight line — a series of fixed appointments. Being on time is a sign of respect, and plans should not change. Germany, Switzerland, and the USA are often described this way. In Asia, Japan is famous for its punctuality. Japanese trains are known for running on time almost to the second, and arriving late for a business meeting is a serious mistake.

Other cultures see time as more flexible. Relationships and people come first, and schedules can change. A meeting may start a little late because the previous conversation was important. In parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia, social events may start later than the official time. Many people joke about "Thai time" or "Filipino time". In business, however, especially in international companies, punctuality is usually expected.

There is also a difference between short-term and long-term thinking. Many Western companies focus on results this quarter or this year. Many Asian companies, especially family businesses, think in decades. A Japanese or Chinese partner may accept slower profits today for a stronger position in ten years.

These differences can cause frustration. A Western partner may think, "Why are they so slow?" An Asian partner may think, "Why are they always in such a hurry?" The best approach is to talk openly about expectations — when exactly is the deadline, and how fixed is it?`,

    reading: `In many Western countries, trust is built through tasks. If you do good work, on time, people trust you. The contract is very important — it is the end of the negotiation and the final word on the deal. If there is a problem, you check the contract.

In much of Asia, trust is built through relationships. People want to know you as a person before they trust your work. The contract is important, but it can be seen as the beginning of the relationship, not the end. If the situation changes, partners may expect to discuss and adjust the deal, rather than simply follow the paper.

This difference can cause problems. A Western company may feel that its Asian partner is "breaking the contract" when they ask to change terms. The Asian partner may feel that the Western company is "cold" and "only cares about the paper".

Feedback is another area of difference. In some Western cultures, like the Netherlands or Germany, negative feedback can be very direct: "This report has many mistakes." In the USA and UK, people often use a "feedback sandwich" — positive comment, then criticism, then another positive comment. In much of Asia, negative feedback is usually given very gently, often privately, and sometimes indirectly through a third person.

When working across cultures, the most important skill is to ask, not assume. "How do you prefer to receive feedback?" is a simple question that can prevent many misunderstandings.`,

In China, people who studied or worked abroad and then came home are called "hǎiguī" (海归). The word sounds like "sea turtle" — an animal that travels across the ocean and returns to the beach where it was born. Many hǎiguī have started successful companies or work in senior roles in international firms.

There are also "third culture kids" — people who grew up in a country different from their parents' home country. A child with Korean parents who grew up in Singapore and studied in Canada may feel at home in all three cultures — and fully at home in none of them. These people are often excellent at understanding different points of view.

Even inside countries, workplaces are changing. Young Japanese, Korean, and Chinese workers are often more direct than their parents. Many international companies in Asia mix local and Western styles — for example, using first names but still respecting hierarchy in big decisions.

Researchers talk about "cultural intelligence", or CQ — the ability to work effectively across cultures. People with high CQ are curious, observe carefully, avoid quick judgements, and adapt their behaviour. The good news is that CQ can be learned.
