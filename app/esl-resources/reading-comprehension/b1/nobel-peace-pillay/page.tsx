    text: `This week, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Navanethem "Navi" Pillay — a South African lawyer and judge who has spent her entire life fighting for human rights and international justice.\n\nThe committee said the prize recognised Pillay "efforts to promote peace and international law" and praised her "firm moral compass" that has remained constant throughout a career spanning more than five decades.\n\nPillay, who is 85 years old, was born into a poor Indian Tamil family in Durban, South Africa, during the apartheid era — a system of racial segregation that denied basic rights to non-white South Africans for nearly 50 years. Her father was a bus driver. Despite the enormous barriers she faced because of her race and gender, she became a lawyer, a judge, and eventually one of the most important figures in international human rights.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is one of the most famous awards in the world. It was created by Alfred Nobel — a Swedish inventor — who wrote in his will in 1895 that the prize should go to the person who has done the most to promote peace between nations. This year, the committee chose Pillay from 287 nominations — 208 individuals and 79 organisations.\n\nFor many people around the world, the award is a reminder that one person life — lived with courage and principle — can change the course of history.`,

    text: `Navi Pillay story begins in the darkest period of South African history.\n\nUnder apartheid, which lasted from 1948 to 1994, South Africa population was divided by race. White South Africans — a minority — controlled everything: the government, the economy, the best land, the best schools, and the best hospitals. Black, Indian, and mixed-race South Africans were treated as second-class citizens. They could not vote. They could not live where they wanted. They could not marry across racial lines. And those who protested were imprisoned, beaten, or killed.\n\nPillay studied law at the University of Natal — one of the few paths available to a young Indian woman who wanted to fight injustice. In 1967, she became the first woman to open a law practice in the Natal province. She spent years defending anti-apartheid activists, trade union leaders, and political prisoners — including prisoners held on Robben Island, the notorious prison where Nelson Mandela was held for 27 years.\n\nHer work was dangerous. The apartheid government viewed her as a threat. She was denied a passport for many years, preventing her from travelling internationally. But she continued her work — quietly, stubbornly, and with enormous courage.\n\nWhen apartheid finally ended in 1994, President Nelson Mandela appointed Pillay to the High Court — making her the first non-white woman judge in South African history. It was a remarkable moment: the woman who had defended prisoners under a racist system was now a judge in the new, democratic South Africa.`,

    text: `After her appointment to the South African High Court, Pillay career went global.\n\nIn 1995, she was elected as a judge at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda — the court set up by the United Nations to try people responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which approximately 800,000 people — mostly ethnic Tutsis — were murdered in just 100 days.\n\nPillay served at the tribunal for eight years, including four years as its president. She made legal history with the Akayesu case — a landmark ruling that established for the first time that rape and sexual violence could be classified as acts of genocide. This decision changed international law forever and gave victims of sexual violence in war a legal path to justice that had never existed before.\n\nIn 2003, she became a judge at the International Criminal Court in The Hague — the permanent court that tries individuals accused of the most serious crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn 2008, she was appointed as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights — the top human rights official in the world. She held this position until 2014, speaking out about abuses in countries from Syria to Sri Lanka, from North Korea to the United States.\n\nMore recently, she chaired the UN commission investigating the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Throughout her career, Pillay has never been afraid to challenge powerful countries — a quality that has earned her both admiration and criticism.`,

    text: `The story of Navi Pillay raises a question that is central to the Nobel Peace Prize itself: can one person really change the world?\n\nThe Nobel committee has always believed so. Past winners include Nelson Mandela, who helped end apartheid. Martin Luther King Jr., who led the American civil rights movement. Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban for going to school and became the youngest-ever Nobel laureate at age 17. And now Navi Pillay — a woman who was born into poverty and discrimination and spent her life building legal systems that protect the most vulnerable people on Earth.\n\nCritics of the Nobel Peace Prize argue that it is sometimes given for political reasons rather than genuine achievement. Some past winners have been controversial — including leaders who later started wars or were accused of human rights abuses. The prize has also been criticised for focusing too much on individuals rather than the movements and organisations that make change possible.\n\nBut Pillay story is hard to argue with. From defending prisoners on Robben Island to establishing that rape is genocide, from leading the world top human rights office to investigating abuses in Gaza — her life is a story of one person refusing to accept that injustice is normal.\n\nIn a world where many people feel powerless — where wars continue, inequality grows, and the powerful seem untouchable — Pillay life is a reminder that change does not always come from armies or governments. Sometimes it comes from a bus driver daughter in Durban who decided that the law should protect everyone equally.`,
