    text: `The International Criminal Court, known as the ICC, is the world's only permanent court for the most serious crimes: war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. It was created in 2002 and is based in The Hague, in the Netherlands.

The ICC exists because the world decided, after the horrors of World War II, Rwanda, and Yugoslavia, that some crimes are too terrible for national courts to handle alone. When a government kills its own people, who puts the leaders on trial? When a powerful country commits war crimes, who holds them accountable? The ICC was supposed to be that court.

Today, 125 countries are members of the ICC, including every country in the European Union and most of NATO. But three of the most powerful countries in the world — the United States, Russia, and China — have never joined. They do not accept that an international court should have power over their citizens.

This means the ICC can investigate war crimes committed by soldiers from small or weak countries, but struggles to touch the powerful ones. Critics say this makes the court unfair. Supporters say it is better to have an imperfect court than no court at all.

On October 9, 2026, the United States went further than simply refusing to join. It attacked the court directly.`,

    text: `On Friday October 9, 2026, the Trump administration imposed sweeping sanctions on the International Criminal Court. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the United States would "ban transactions with this rogue court."

This was not just a political statement. Sanctions have real power. American companies are banned from working with the ICC. Banks may close the court's accounts. Insurance companies may cancel their policies. Software companies — like Microsoft — may be forced to stop providing services.

The ICC had been preparing for months. Staff moved their computers from Microsoft software to open-source alternatives. They found new banks and new health insurance providers. They knew the sanctions were coming.

The United States sanctioned 17 ICC judges and officials in total. The court's deputy prosecutor, Nazhat Shameem Khan, said: "Our work will continue across all our situations, our investigations and our prosecutions."

Why did the US do this? Two main reasons. First, the ICC had investigated American soldiers for possible war crimes in Afghanistan. Second — and more importantly for Washington — the ICC had issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials over actions in Gaza. The US considers Israel its closest ally and will not allow an international court to charge its leaders.

The timing was extraordinary. The sanctions came just hours after former ICC judge Navi Pillay was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.`,

    text: `The Nobel Prize committee said it chose Navi Pillay to "issue a reminder" about the pressure facing international law institutions. In other words, the prize was a message: the world needs these courts, even when powerful countries try to destroy them.

But the United States was not alone in its hostility. Russia has long refused to cooperate with the ICC. When the court issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin in 2023 for the deportation of Ukrainian children, Russia simply ignored it. China has never accepted the court's authority.

This creates a dangerous situation. If the most powerful countries can ignore the ICC, what is the point of international justice? If a soldier from a small African country commits a war crime, the ICC can arrest and try them. But if a leader of the United States, Russia, or China does the same thing, nothing happens.

The ICC's supporters say this is exactly why the court must survive. Without it, there is no institution that even tries to hold the powerful accountable. The court has convicted leaders from Congo, Uganda, and the Central African Republic. It has given victims a voice they would never have had otherwise.

The court's registrar urged the European Union to protect it from American sanctions. The EU has a legal mechanism called a "blocking regulation" that shields European organisations from the effects of foreign sanctions. Whether Europe will use it remains to be seen.`,

1. The ICC was created to make sure nobody is above the law. But the most powerful countries refuse to join. Does this mean international justice is impossible, or is it still worth trying?

2. The US says no international court should have power over American citizens. Do you agree? Should every country have the right to refuse international courts?

3. Navi Pillay won the Nobel Peace Prize on the same day the US sanctioned the ICC. The prize committee said it was a "reminder." What were they trying to remind the world of?

4. Imagine a soldier from your country committed a war crime. Would you want an international court to put them on trial, or should your own country handle it?

5. The ICC moved from Microsoft to free software to survive. What does this tell us about the power of technology companies in world politics?

Is it possible to have justice without power? Can a court that cannot force the biggest countries to obey actually change anything?`,
