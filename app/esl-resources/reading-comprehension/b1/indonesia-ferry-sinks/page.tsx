    text: `A passenger ferry capsized off the north coast of Java, Indonesia, this weekend, killing at least six people and leaving 129 missing. The vessel, which was carrying 135 passengers and crew on a routine journey between two Indonesian islands, overturned in rough seas during a sudden storm.\n\nRescue operations are underway, with the Indonesian navy, coast guard, and local fishing boats searching a wide area of the Java Sea. Survivors described terrifying scenes — the ship rolling suddenly, water flooding the lower decks, and passengers scrambling for life jackets in the dark. Many passengers were asleep when the ship capsized in the early hours of the morning.\n\nSo far, only six survivors have been found — clinging to debris or wearing life jackets. The chances of finding more survivors diminish with every passing hour, as the water temperature and currents work against those still in the sea.\n\nIndonesia is an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, and ferries are the primary means of transport between them. Millions of Indonesians rely on ferry services every year to visit family, travel for work, or transport goods. But the country ferry safety record is among the worst in the world — with deadly sinkings occurring with tragic regularity.`,

    text: `Ferry disasters in Southeast Asia are not freak accidents — they are the predictable result of systemic problems that have been ignored for decades.\n\nOvercrowding is the most common cause. Many ferries carry far more passengers than they are designed for, particularly during holidays and festivals when demand surges. Operators who turn away passengers lose money, so they pack people in — often without enough life jackets for everyone on board.\n\nPoor maintenance is widespread. Many ferries operating in Indonesian, Philippine, and Bangladeshi waters are decades old, poorly maintained, and would not pass safety inspections in wealthier countries. Engines fail. Hulls leak. Navigation equipment does not work. And when something goes wrong at sea, there is no roadside assistance — you are on your own.\n\nWeak regulation allows unsafe operators to continue running. Maritime safety authorities in many developing countries are underfunded, understaffed, and sometimes corrupt. Inspections are irregular. Violations are overlooked. And when a disaster occurs, the investigation often reveals that warnings had been given and ignored.\n\nWeather adds a final layer of danger. Tropical seas can change quickly — calm conditions can become dangerous storms within an hour. Many smaller ferries are not equipped with modern weather forecasting technology, and captains sometimes depart in conditions that are already marginal.`,

    text: `Ferry disasters are disproportionately concentrated in a handful of countries — and Southeast Asia is the epicentre.\n\nThe Philippines experiences an average of 20 significant maritime incidents per year. The sinking of the MV Dona Paz in 1987 — which killed more than 4,000 people — remains the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in history. Bangladesh loses dozens of ferry passengers every year in overcrowded river boats. And Indonesia, with its vast archipelago and heavy dependence on maritime transport, has seen multiple deadly sinkings in recent years.\n\nThe contrast with wealthier countries is stark. Ferry systems in Japan, Norway, and Canada transport millions of passengers annually with near-perfect safety records. The difference is not geography or weather — it is investment in safety, enforcement of regulations, and a culture that prioritises passenger welfare over profit.\n\nThailand, while not experiencing ferry disasters as frequently as Indonesia or the Philippines, has had its own incidents — particularly in the Gulf of Thailand and around popular tourist islands. The 2019 speedboat accident near Koh Samui that killed several tourists highlighted the risks of inadequately regulated maritime transport.\n\nFor the millions of people across Southeast Asia who depend on ferries for basic transport, the question is not academic. It is personal: when you step onto a ferry to visit your family or go to work, can you trust that the boat is safe, the captain is qualified, and someone has checked that there are enough life jackets?`,

    text: `The 129 people missing from the Indonesian ferry are not statistics. They are parents, children, workers, students, and grandparents who boarded a boat expecting to arrive safely on the other side.\n\nFerry passengers in Southeast Asia are overwhelmingly ordinary people — not wealthy tourists but working families who take the boat because it is the only affordable way to travel between islands. They carry boxes of goods to sell at market, bags of school supplies for their children, and gifts for relatives they have not seen in months. The ferry is not a luxury — it is a lifeline.\n\nWhen a ferry sinks, the people who die are almost always the poorest. Wealthier travellers can afford to fly. The people on the ferry are those who have no other option. This makes ferry safety a question of justice as much as regulation — the poor should not face a higher risk of death simply because they cannot afford a plane ticket.\n\nThe Indonesian government has pledged to improve ferry safety after every major disaster. New regulations have been announced, inspections have been promised, and officials have expressed condolences and concern. But the disasters keep happening — because the structural problems that cause them — poverty, weak institutions, corruption, and underinvestment — remain unchanged.\n\n129 people are missing in the Java Sea tonight. Their families are waiting by the phone, watching the news, hoping for a miracle. And somewhere in Indonesia, another overloaded ferry is preparing to depart.`,
