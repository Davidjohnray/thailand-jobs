    text: `On 20 August 2026, Israel's military announced its first criminal investigations into the conduct of its own troops in Gaza. The investigations focus on two incidents: the killing of five-year-old Hind Rajab and her family, and the deaths of 15 Palestinian paramedics. For many observers, the announcement — coming more than two years after the events — was both overdue and insufficient. For others, it represented an important, if belated, acknowledgement that accountability matters even in war.\n\nHind Rajab's story became one of the most devastating narratives of the Gaza war. In February 2024, the five-year-old was trapped in a car with her family members, who had been killed by gunfire. She called the Palestinian Red Crescent by phone, crying and begging for help. The call was recorded and later broadcast worldwide. Two paramedics were dispatched to rescue her. All three — Hind and both paramedics — were found dead, their vehicle destroyed.\n\nThe case attracted international attention because of its stark simplicity: a terrified child asking for help, rescuers trying to reach her, and all of them killed. The recording of Hind's phone call — her small voice asking "Am I going to die?" — became a symbol of civilian suffering in Gaza that transcended political positions.\n\nIsrael's decision to investigate is significant because the country has historically been reluctant to prosecute its own soldiers for actions during military operations. Human rights organisations have long argued that Israel's internal investigation mechanisms are inadequate and designed to produce acquittals rather than accountability.`,

    text: `War is not lawless. International humanitarian law — often called the "laws of war" — sets rules that all parties to a conflict must follow, even in the most extreme circumstances. These rules exist because civilisation decided centuries ago that even in war, there are things that should never be done.\n\nThe most fundamental principle is distinction — the requirement to distinguish between combatants (soldiers) and civilians, and to direct attacks only against military targets. Deliberately attacking civilians is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Attacking a hospital, a school, or an ambulance — unless it is being used for military purposes — is prohibited.\n\nThe principle of proportionality requires that even legitimate military attacks must not cause civilian harm that is excessive relative to the military advantage gained. Destroying an entire residential block to kill one enemy fighter would violate this principle, even if the fighter was a legitimate target.\n\nThe principle of precaution requires parties to take all feasible steps to minimise civilian casualties — warning civilians before an attack, choosing weapons that reduce collateral damage, and cancelling attacks when civilian harm would be disproportionate.\n\nThe Gaza war has raised profound questions about all three principles. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority of them civilians according to health authorities. Hospitals, schools, refugee shelters, and ambulances have been struck repeatedly. Israel argues that Hamas deliberately operates from civilian areas, using the population as human shields — which is itself a war crime. Critics argue that regardless of Hamas's actions, Israel's response has been disproportionate and insufficiently discriminate.`,

    text: `One of the most difficult questions in international law is: who holds soldiers and governments accountable when the laws of war are broken?\n\nThe International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, was created in 2002 to prosecute individuals accused of the most serious crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC has issued arrest warrants related to the Gaza conflict — though enforcement is challenging because major powers including the United States, Russia, China, and Israel do not recognise the court's jurisdiction.\n\nNational courts can also prosecute war crimes. Many countries have laws allowing them to try individuals for crimes committed anywhere in the world — a principle called "universal jurisdiction." Belgian, German, and Spanish courts have all heard cases involving foreign war crimes. But national prosecutions are rare and politically sensitive.\n\nIsrael's decision to investigate its own troops through military courts represents a third approach — internal accountability. This is the approach that most countries prefer, because it allows them to maintain control over the process. But critics argue that military courts investigating their own soldiers face inherent conflicts of interest — the institution investigating is the same institution responsible for the actions being investigated.\n\nThe Trump administration's response to the ICC has added another dimension. This week, the US imposed sanctions on the ICC's president and senior prosecutor — an unprecedented move that many legal scholars described as an attempt to shield allies from international accountability. The message was clear: the world's most powerful country will actively obstruct the international institutions designed to enforce the laws of war.`,

    number: 4, title: 'Why Accountability Matters', emoji: '🌍', color: '#7f1d1d',
    text: `The investigation into Hind Rajab's death is one small step in a much larger question: does accountability for wartime atrocities actually change anything?\n\nSceptics argue that it does not. The ICC has been operating for more than 20 years and has completed only a handful of cases. Many of those indicted have never been arrested. Powerful countries routinely ignore international law when it is inconvenient. The laws of war are violated in virtually every conflict. What difference does one investigation make?\n\nBut the case for accountability is deeper than individual prosecutions. When crimes are documented, investigated, and judged — even imperfectly — a record is created. That record matters because it establishes truth. It says: this happened, it was wrong, and it will not be denied or forgotten. For victims and their families, official acknowledgement of what was done to them can be a crucial part of healing — even when the perpetrators are never punished.\n\nAccountability also shapes the future. When soldiers know that their actions may be investigated and prosecuted, they are more likely to follow the laws of war. When commanders know they may be held personally responsible for the actions of their troops, they are more likely to enforce discipline. Perfect compliance is impossible — but the existence of accountability mechanisms changes behaviour at the margins, and at the margins is where lives are saved.\n\nHind Rajab was five years old. She called for help, and nobody came in time. The investigation into her death will not bring her back. But it may — just possibly — make it slightly less likely that the next five-year-old dies in the same way. And that, however inadequate it feels, is why accountability matters.`,
