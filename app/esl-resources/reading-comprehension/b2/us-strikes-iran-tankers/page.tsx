    text: `The naval dimension of the US-Iran conflict escalated dramatically this weekend. US forces struck three Iranian oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, claiming they were facilitating attacks on international shipping. Hours later, Iranian ballistic missiles targeted US Navy warships — an aircraft carrier and a destroyer — in one of the most significant naval exchanges since the conflict began.\n\nThe Pentagon said no US personnel were hurt and that the Iranian missiles were intercepted. Iran claimed its strikes caused damage, though this has not been independently confirmed. The US military released footage of burning tankers, while Iranian state media broadcast what it described as missile launches targeting the American carrier group.\n\nThe exchange marks a new phase in the conflict. Previous naval engagements had involved mines, drones, and small-boat harassment. Ballistic missiles targeting an aircraft carrier represent a significant escalation — these are weapons designed to sink the world most powerful warships. The fact that Iran used them, even if unsuccessfully, signals a willingness to take risks that could trigger a much wider war.\n\nOil prices surged on the news. Brent crude rose more than 5% in a single trading session, adding to the record diesel prices already straining the global economy. Shipping insurance rates for the Gulf doubled overnight. And several major shipping companies announced they would reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope — adding weeks and millions of dollars to delivery times.`,

    text: `The Strait of Hormuz has become a naval chessboard where both sides are making increasingly aggressive moves — each testing the other limits while trying to avoid the move that triggers all-out war.\n\nThe US Navy has positioned a carrier strike group, multiple destroyers, and submarine assets in and around the Gulf. These forces provide overwhelming firepower but are also vulnerable — a carrier, however powerful, is a large, visible target operating in confined waters where anti-ship missiles have short flight times.\n\nIran cannot match the US Navy in conventional terms. But it has developed an asymmetric naval strategy specifically designed to exploit the vulnerabilities of larger, more expensive forces. Fast attack boats can swarm and overwhelm a ship defences. Shore-based anti-ship missiles can be hidden in civilian areas along the Iranian coast. Underwater mines can be deployed at night from small fishing vessels. And the confined geography of the Strait means that US ships have limited room to manoeuvre.\n\nThe exchange this weekend demonstrated both sides capabilities and limitations. The US can strike Iranian assets with precision. Iran can threaten US warships with missiles. Neither side achieved a decisive advantage — and both sides were reminded that the next exchange could produce casualties that dramatically change the political calculus.\n\nMilitary historians note that naval conflicts have a particular tendency to escalate. Unlike land battles, where advances can be measured in kilometres and pauses are common, naval engagements often intensify rapidly because both sides feel vulnerable in an environment they cannot control.`,

    text: `The targeting of Iranian oil tankers reveals an uncomfortable truth about the US strategy: the conflict is increasingly about economic warfare as much as military force.\n\nIran exports approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil per day — mostly to China, which has continued purchasing Iranian crude despite US sanctions. By striking tankers, the US is physically preventing oil from reaching market — a more aggressive approach than sanctions, which rely on the cooperation of other countries.\n\nThe economic logic is clear: cut Iran oil revenue and you cut its ability to fund military operations, support proxy groups, and sustain its population. Without oil income — which accounts for roughly 40% of government revenue — Iran economy would collapse within months.\n\nBut the strategy carries enormous risks. Every tanker destroyed removes oil from the global market, pushing prices higher. The irony is stark: the US is fighting to keep the Strait of Hormuz open for international shipping while simultaneously attacking ships in that strait. The actions contradict each other — and the global economy pays the price of both.\n\nChina has warned that attacks on tankers carrying oil it has legally purchased represent an infringement on Chinese commercial interests — adding a dangerous third dimension to what was already a bilateral conflict. If China decides to escort its own tankers through the Strait, the US would face the prospect of confronting not just Iran but the world second-largest military power.`,

    text: `The naval exchanges in the Strait of Hormuz this weekend are part of a conflict that has no obvious endpoint — and that is precisely what makes it so dangerous.\n\nNeither side can win a decisive military victory. The US has overwhelming naval superiority but cannot invade Iran — a country of 90 million people with a battle-hardened military and difficult terrain. Iran cannot defeat the US Navy but can impose costs — in ships damaged, oil prices raised, and allies alienated — that make the conflict expensive and politically unsustainable.\n\nThe result is likely to be a war of attrition — not over territory but over economic endurance. The US is betting that sanctions and military pressure will eventually force Iran to negotiate on American terms. Iran is betting that the economic and political costs of the conflict will eventually exhaust American patience. Both sides may be right — and both sides may be wrong.\n\nFor the rest of the world, the Hormuz crisis is a reminder of a fundamental vulnerability: the global economy depends on the free movement of oil through a handful of narrow waterways controlled by governments that may not have the world best interests at heart. Until the world reduces its dependence on oil — through renewable energy, electrification, and efficiency — this vulnerability will persist.\n\nThe tankers are burning. The missiles are flying. The oil prices are climbing. And somewhere in the middle of the Strait of Hormuz, the future of the global economy is being decided by warships, missiles, and the terrible logic of escalation.`,
