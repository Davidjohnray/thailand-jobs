    text: `In July 2026, astronomers announced one of the strangest discoveries in recent space science: a Sun-like star that appears to have eaten one of its own planets. The evidence? An unusually high concentration of lithium in the star — a chemical fingerprint that should not be there, and that can only be explained if the star recently consumed a rocky, Earth-like planet that was orbiting too close.\n\nThe discovery, published in a leading scientific journal, was made by analysing the light emitted by the star — a technique called spectroscopy that allows scientists to determine what chemicals a star contains by examining the specific wavelengths of light it produces. When the team noticed lithium levels far higher than expected for a star of this type and age, they knew something unusual had happened. Lithium is destroyed inside stars at relatively low temperatures, so finding large amounts of it suggests a recent external source — and the most likely source is a planet.\n\nThe idea of a star devouring its own planet sounds like science fiction, but it is actually a well-established theoretical possibility. As stars age, they expand. A star that grows large enough can engulf planets that orbit close to it — quite literally swallowing them whole. Our own Sun will do exactly this in about five billion years, expanding to become a "red giant" that will engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth.\n\nBut this particular discovery was different because the star in question is not old enough to be expanding. It is roughly the same age and size as our Sun, which means something else caused the planet to spiral inward — perhaps gravitational interactions with other planets in the system, knocking the doomed world off its stable orbit and sending it on a death spiral into its parent star.`,

    text: `The process of a star consuming a planet is not instant — it unfolds over thousands or even millions of years, and it is both violent and strangely beautiful.\n\nAs a planet spirals closer to its star, it first loses its atmosphere. The intense heat and radiation strip away the gases that surround the planet, creating a spectacular tail of material streaming away from the doomed world — similar to the tail of a comet, but on a vastly larger scale. At this stage, the planet is essentially being slowly undressed by its star.\n\nAs it gets closer still, the gravitational forces become so strong that the planet begins to break apart. The side of the planet facing the star is pulled more strongly than the far side, stretching the planet into an elongated shape. Eventually, the tidal forces overcome the planet\'s own gravity, and it is torn into fragments that spiral into the star like water going down a drain.\n\nThe final act is consumption. The rocky material from the destroyed planet falls into the outer layers of the star, temporarily changing its chemical composition. This is what the astronomers detected — the lithium signature was the star\'s cosmic indigestion, the chemical evidence of a meal it had recently eaten.\n\nThe entire process has been simulated using supercomputers, and the visualisations are stunning — swirling spirals of rock and gas being drawn inexorably into a ball of fire a million times larger than Earth. It is a reminder that the universe, for all its beauty, is also a place of extraordinary violence.\n\nScientists estimate that planetary consumption may be more common than previously thought. As many as one in four Sun-like stars may show signs of having eaten planets during their lifetimes — making our own solar system, where the planets have remained in stable orbits for 4.5 billion years, somewhat unusual.`,

    text: `Every discovery about other solar systems teaches us something about our own. The planet-eating star raises questions that are directly relevant to the future of Earth — not in the immediate future, but on timescales that force us to think about our place in the universe.\n\nThe most obvious connection is the fate of Earth itself. In approximately five billion years, our Sun will exhaust its hydrogen fuel and begin to expand into a red giant. As it swells, it will first engulf Mercury, then Venus. Whether it will reach Earth is still debated — some models suggest Earth will spiral outward as the Sun loses mass and avoid being consumed, while others suggest it will be swallowed. Either way, the Earth will become uninhabitable long before the Sun reaches it, as the increasing heat boils away the oceans and strips away the atmosphere.\n\nFive billion years is an almost incomprehensible amount of time — but the discovery that stars can consume planets even before they become red giants adds an element of unpredictability. Gravitational disturbances from passing stars, rogue planets, or even undiscovered objects in our own solar system could, in theory, alter planetary orbits on shorter timescales. The probability is extremely low, but it is not zero.\n\nMore practically, the discovery contributes to our understanding of which solar systems are likely to harbour stable, long-lived planets — and therefore which might be good candidates for hosting life. If planetary consumption is common, then the conditions needed for life — a stable orbit in the habitable zone for billions of years — may be rarer than we thought. This has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life and for our understanding of how special Earth might actually be.`,

    text: `In a week dominated by war, migration, political crises, and economic anxiety, a story about a distant star eating a planet might seem trivial. But there is a reason these stories consistently capture public attention — and the reason goes deeper than simple curiosity.\n\nSpace stories give us perspective. The problems that dominate our daily news — conflicts between nations, economic fluctuations, political scandals — are enormously important to the people affected by them. But from the perspective of a star system millions of light-years away, they are invisible. The universe does not know or care about our borders, our economies, or our arguments. There is something both humbling and liberating about this realisation.\n\nSpace stories also remind us of what human beings are capable of at their best. The ability to determine what a star is made of by analysing its light — from a distance so vast that the light took years to reach us — is an extraordinary achievement of human intelligence, patience, and cooperation. It required centuries of accumulated knowledge, international collaboration between scientists, and technologies that did not exist a generation ago. In a world that often feels defined by division and conflict, space science is a reminder that humans can also work together to understand the universe.\n\nFinally, space stories connect us to something bigger than ourselves. The lithium in the planet-eating star, the iron in your blood, the oxygen you are breathing right now — all of it was created inside stars that lived and died billions of years ago. We are, quite literally, made of star stuff. Understanding the universe is not an escape from the world — it is a way of understanding our place in it.\n\nA star ate a planet this week. It is the most wonderfully absurd sentence in the news. And that is exactly why it matters.`,
